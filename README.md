# APT Alert NYC

###GA WDI NYC Jan 14, Project 1

### Overview

**APT Alert NYC** was designed to discover apartments in New York City based on the user's local or search area. The users will be notified when a new apartment that fits their criteria has been listed in their search area.

This application is still under development and will eventually include features to locate users by geo-location and for users to search by neighborhood. The criteria options will added for more precise searching. 

This application was developed over a 3 day sprint to model the agile software development process. 

It was developed as my first project using Ruby on Rails for the January 2014 Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly.
